# Watson Node-RED services labs

In this section, Watson services are highlighted. The labs will show you how you can use the services in Node-RED.
The labs will require that you have instances of the Watson services you need. For instructions on how to instantiate
and use the Watson services inside Node-RED follow this link.

- [Using Watson Services](../using_watson_services/README.md)

NOTE : All the labs listed below assume that you have first created an Application from the customised [Node-RED Starter Boilerplate](http://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-red-bluemix-starter). If you have used the [Bluemix Node-RED Starter Boilerplate](../introduction_to_node_red/README.md) then you may find that not all the nodes area available on the Node-RED pallete. If you have instantiated the Bluemix boilerplate and would like to incorporate the latest Watson nodes then please follow the instructions [here](../watson_contribution_nodes/README.md)
