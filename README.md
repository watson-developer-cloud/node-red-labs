# Watson-Node-Red-examples

A collection of examples on how to use the Watson nodes in Node-RED.

These Watson nodes are used:

- Language Identification
- Language Translation
- Personality insights
- Speech to Text
- Text to Speech
- Tradeoff Analytics
- Visual Recognition


First you need an instance of Node-RED with Watson services. Therefore you need a Bluemix account. You can get that here: http://www.bluemix.net.

Once you are in Bluemix, go to Catalog and then go to the boilerplate section and select Node-RED Starter, in the next screen, give your appication a name and click create.

You need to add the services you want to use to your appication. Go to the dashboard and click on your application, then click on Add a Service or API. In the folowing screen select the service you want to use, and finally click on use. Wait for a moment to restart the application. When the application is started you can click on the URL to open Node-RED.

Another way of using Node-RED is installing it locally, which can be done by folowing this:

Check out http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/ for full instructions on getting started.
sjk

    sudo npm install -g node-red
    node-red
    Open http://localhost:1880
    
You have to install the Watson Nodes, which is described here: http://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-bluemix-nodes
and you have to make the services available in Bluemix.
