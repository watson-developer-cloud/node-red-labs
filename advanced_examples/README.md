# Watson on Node-RED Advanced Labs

In this part of the project you can find the advanced labs. In these labs different services are combined to build apps to show the possibilities of Watson in Node-RED.

Before trying out these labs, you should:
- have created an application from the IBM Cloud Node-RED Starter Boilerplate. Refer to the following [instructions](/introduction_to_node_red/README.md) for how to get started.
- already be comfortable with Node-RED flows and how to import flows. if not then [read and understand the process](/introduction_to_node_red/README.md) on how to import flows.

The advanced labs are:
- [Train the Visual Recognition service with your own images](visual_recognition_training/README.md)
- [Speech to Text Timestamps](speech_to_text_timestamps/README.md)
- [Classify webcasts (in progress, not completed yet)](webcast_classifier/README.md)
- [Sending a file to Watson Recognition for classification from a webpage](visual_recognition_file_send/README.md)

Advanced labs with deprecated nodes are available for reference here:
- [Alchemy API Image analysis](deprecated_nodes/alchemy_image_analysis_thumbs/README.md)
- [Image to speech with Alchemy](deprecated_nodes/alchemy_image_to_speech/README.md)
- [Create a table from Alchemy feature extract](deprecated_nodes/alchemy_output_table/README.md)
- [Use a widget with Trade off Analytics](deprecated_nodes/tradeoff_analytics_widget/README.md)
